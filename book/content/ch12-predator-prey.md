# Predator and prey

Competition and mutualism can be understood without much attention to the sizes
of the species involved. But predation is quite different. Think of a producer,
the prey, and a consumer, the predator. When the consumer is extremely large and
the producer very small, as with a whale and krill, the relationship is called
filter feeding. There the predator kills the prey. When the producer and
consumer are roughly matched in size, they are called predators and prey. When
the producer is much smaller than the consumer, but still independently mobile,
the relationship is called parasitism. And when the consumer is much smaller
still, and has difficulty moving around on its own, the relationship is called
infection and disease. Symptoms of disease are part of the ecology of disease.
In parasitism and disease, the consumer often does not kill the producer.

### 12.1 Further examples of predation

Amazing mechanisms for both capturing prey and avoiding predators have
been discovered through evolution.
Fulmar chicks,[$^\star$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulmar), for example, can direct
"projectile vomit" at predators approaching the nest too closely
(Figure 12.1[#fig_12_1]). This is not just icky for the predator. By
damaging the waterproofing of an avian predator's feathers, this ultimately can
kill the predator. The chick's projectile vomit is thus a lethal weapon.
