# Competition

Ecological competition is a potent force driving organic evolution.
When [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin)
reached the [Galapagos Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal√°pagos_Islands)
at age 26, he studied an assortment of fifteen similar species that are now
called ["Darwin's Finches"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin's_finches)({numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_2>`). His observation that various species had different beak structures, specialized for different foods, led him to question the stability of species. Indeed, such "character displacement" is one of several consequences of ecological competition.

### 16.1 The niche concept

A species' niche is the range of environmental factors that allow that species
to survive and reproduce. A particular tree species, for example, may be able to
live where temperatures do not drop below $-40^\circ$, and where yearly
precipitation is at least 750 mm. Perhaps it also needs open sunlight and an
appropriate collection of [root fungi.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza)
Such are the parameters of a niche.

[G. Evelyn Hutchinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Evelyn_Hutchinson), one
of the great ecologists of the twentieth century, envisioned the parameters that
form a niche as an "$n$-dimensional hyperspace." The "fundamental niche" is the set of conditions allowing the species to survive if there are no other species interfering. Physical conditions are chief among those. The "realized niche" is the real life niche---where species are restricted by interactions with other species.

Consider latitude on the earth's surface, which is connected to several parameters such as sunlight and temperature. And consider two species that can
thrive anywhere between $40^\circ$ and $60^\circ$ latitude, and whose
density drops slowly with increasing latitude ({numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_3>`).

**Figure 16.3.** `<figdef tag="FigLatitudeCrossover">`
Species living apart along a spatial gradient (above) and living together
along the same gradient (below).
`</figdef>`

At the top of the figure are two nearly horizontal lines representing the
abundance you might observe of the two species as you travel north. If free of
Species 2 (its competitor), Species 1 (blue line) declines slowly in abundance
in more northerly climates. Species 2 similarly declines in abundance (red
line), but compared with Species 1 fares a little better in the north and a
little worse in the south.

When these two species are together they compete with each other---each
suppressing the other. Using competition equations like those presented in this
chapter, we see that in the south, where Species 1 fares better, it takes over
and dominates. In the north, in contrast, where Species 2 fares better, it dominates instead ({numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_3>`, bottom).

You see that there can be a sharp change in abundance even with only very slight
changes in species characteristics. A range of one species can end and that of a
new species can begin, even though you may not be able to discover anything from
either species alone as to why they switch their dominance. And the switch-over
point need not correspond to the exact place in which their dominance switches.
Here the actual switch-over point is a few degrees to the north because of the
migration simulated in the model. This phenomenon is called "competitive
exclusion" and, when it occurs over space like this, "zonation."

**Figure 16.4.** `<figdef tag="FigZonationBlueBirdPrairie">`
Zonation on a three-year-old fen, Bluebird Prairie, Upper Midwest.
`</figdef>`

Any environmental gradient can induce zonation.
{numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_4>`  illustrates this on a restored prairie in the North American Upper Midwest. Though less than ten meters, the variation in elevation is enough to induce a mild moisture gradient. The entire area had been converted from a corn field to a restored prairie and seeded uniformly with a mixture of prairie grasses and prairie flowers, but distinct boundaries arose only three years after restoration.

All the upland areas, labeled 1, contained standard restored prairie flora such
as [*Andropogon gerardi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andropogon_gerardi)
(Big Bluestem grass) and rapidly emerging flowers such as [*Rudbekia
hirta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudbeckia) (Black-eyed Susan). But in
successive zones surrounding mild depressions in the landscape, labeled 2 to 4,
there were sharp transitions to moisture-loving genera such as [*Typha
latifolia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typha_latifolia) (cattail) and
[*Stachys palustris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stachys_palustris)
(Smartweed).

### 16.2 Resource competition

Competition among two species occurs when the interaction terms $s_{1,2}$
and $s_{2,1}$ in Equation {eq}`eq_16_1`  are both negative. 
This rather abstract approach does lead to broad insights, but for other kinds
of insights let us proceed to a more *mechanistic* view. Instead of
abstract coefficients representing inhibition among species, let us consider
*resources* which species need to thrive and survive. The species will not
interact directly---they never even need to come into contact---but will
influence each other through their use of a common resource, which they both
need for maintenance and growth of their populations.

Resource competition is one of the oldest parts of ecological theory, introduced
in the late 1920s by mathematician [Vivo
Volterra.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Volterra) We will start where he
started, considering what have been called "abiotic resources".

**Figure 16.5.** `<figdef tag="FigResourceLowMediumHigh">`
Growth curve generalized for any resource, with a piece-wise linear
approximation sketched as dashed lines.
`</figdef>`

Species require sunlight, space, nitrogen, phosphorous, and other resources in
various amounts. If a resource is too rare, populations cannot grow, and in fact
will decline. In {numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_5>` this is shown in the
region to the left of the arrow marked A, in which the individual growth rate
$1/N\,dN/dt$ is negative.

At higher resource levels the growth rate increases and, at point A, the
population can just barely maintain itself. Here the individual growth rate
$1/N\,dN/dt$ is zero. This level of resources is called $R^\star$,
pronounced "are star". At higher levels of resource, above $R^\star$,
the population grows because $1/N\,dN/dt$ becomes positive.

Once resources are abundant---approximately above B in the figure---needs are
satiated and the addition of more resources does not make any large difference.
Population growth stays approximately the same between marks B and C.

At very high levels, too much resource can actually harm the population. Too
much sunlight can burn leaves, for example, while too much nitrogen can damage
roots. At this point, above C in Figure {numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_5>`, the
growth rate starts falling. By D the species can again just barely hold its own,
and to the right of D the species is killed by an overabundance of resources.

**Figure 16.6.** `<figdef tag="FigResourceLowOnly">`
Growth curve with only the left linear piece of
Figure *FigResourceLowMediumHigh*, usable because species tend to keep
resources low.
`</figdef>`

Such high resource levels, however, are not usually observed, because species
draw resources concentrations down by using them up. Unless extreme environments
are being modelled, only the left dashed linear piece of {numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_5>`  needs to be modelled, as shown in
{numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_6>`.

At this point, it is helpful to review various forms for the equation of a
straight line. The usual slope--intercept form---$y=mx+b$, which is a
$y$-intercept form---is not as useful here. It's the $x$-intercept form,
$y=m(x-a)$, that comesinto play for writing a mechanistic resource model
for single species population growth.

    |\_
    |\EndTable $$ }

The zero-growth point, $R^\star$, is important in the theory of resource
competition. It is the amount of resource that just barely sustains the species.
If the resource level is less than $R^\star$, the species dies out; if it is
greater, the species grows and expands. The resource level in the environment
therefore is expected to be at or near the $R^\star$ value of the dominant
species. If it is above that level, the population grows, new individuals use
more resource, and the resource level is consequently reduced until growth
stops.

$R^\star$ can be measured in the greenhouse or the field. In the greenhouse, for
example, you might arrange plants in 20 pots and give them different amounts of
nitrogen fertilizer in sterile, nutrient-free soil. In the complete absence of
fertilizer, the plants will die. With larger amounts of fertilizer the plants
will be luxuriant, and when there is too much fertilizer, the resource will
become toxic, again leading to dieback in the plants. You can thus measure the
curve of {numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_5>`  fairly easily and find the
point on the left where the plants just survive. This is their $R^\star$.

You can also measure this value for different species independently, and from
the results estimate how plants will fare living together. To start, suppose
that one resource is the most limiting. Represent the amount of that limiting
resource available in the environment at time $t$ by the symbol $R(t)$
or, for shorthand, simply $R$. The amount in excess of minimal needs is
$R-R^\star$, and that amount of excess will determine the rate of growth. A
tiny excess will mean slow growth, but a larger excess can support faster
growth. So the equation in {numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_6>`  shows the
individual growth rate, $1/N\,dN/dt$, being proportional to how much
resource exists in excess.

As before, $N$ measures the size of the population at time $t$, in
number of individuals, total biomass, or whatever units are relevant to the
species being studied. $R^\star$ is the smallest amount of resource that
can support a viable population, and $m$ tells how the individual growth
rate, $(1/N)\,dN/dt$, depends on the amount of resource available in excess of
minimal needs.

Now let us say that $R_{\rm max}$ is the maximum amount of resource available in
the environment, in absence of any organisms, and $u$ is the amount of
resource used by each living organism in the population. Then $uN$ is the amount
of resource tied up in the population at time $t$. $R_{\rm max}\!-\!uN = R$ is
the amount of resource *not* used by the population. This is the basis of a
resource theory that assumes resources are released immediately upon death of an
organism, and it has many of the important properties of more complex resource
models.

Start with the above statements in algebraic form,
<eqdef tag="EqResourceSingle"/>
$$ {1\over N}{dN\over dt} = m(R-R^\star) \hbox{\hskip1em and \hskip1em}
                        R = R_{\rm max}-u N \eqno(\EqResourceSingle) $$
then substitute the equation on the right above into the one on the left.
This gives
$$ {1\over N}{dN\over dt} = m\bigg( \underbrace{R_{\rm max}-\phantom{_{I_\scriptstyle J}}\kern-.7em u N}_{\displaystyle R}-R^\star \bigg) $$
Multiplying through on the right by $m$ and rearranging terms gives
<eqdef tag="EqResourceSingleRSN"/>
$$ {1\over N}{dN\over dt} = m(R_{\rm max}-R^\star)-u m N
   \eqno(\EqResourceSingleRSN) $$

Notice that the first term on the right is a constant and the second term is a
constant times $N$. Does this look familiar? This is just density-regulated
population growth in disguise---the $r+sN$ model again!
$$ {1\over N}{dN\over dt} = r + s N,
   \hskip1em r=m(R_{\rm max}-R^\star),
   \hskip1em s=-u m $$

Recall that this also happened for the epidemiological $I$ model. And it will
arise occur again in future models.

### 16.3 Competitive exclusion

Consider what will happen with two species using the same resource, such as
light or space or nitrogen fertilizer. The amount of resource available will be
the maximum amount, $R_{\rm max}$, minus what is tied up in all individuals of
all species. With $u_i$ being the amount of resource tied up in each individual
of species $i$, the resource remaining at any time will be
$$ R = R_{\rm max} - u_1 N_1 - u_2 N_2 $$
Or for many species
$$ R = R_{\rm max} - u_1 N_1 - u_2 N_2 - u_3 N_3 - \cdots - u_h N_h $$
$$ R = R_{\rm max} - \sum_{i=1}^h {u_i N_i} \eqno(\EqCompetition-nspR) $$
<eqdef EqCompetition-nspR/>

Each species has its own growth equation, identical in form for all species, but
different in the critical level of resource, $R_i^\star$, and the growth
coefficient, $m_i$:
<eqdef EqCompetition-nspN/>
$$ {1\over N_i}{dN_i\over dt} = m_i(R-R_i^\star) \eqno(\EqCompetition-nspN) $$

What remains is to consider how the growth coefficient $m_i$ relates to the
minimal level of resource tolerated, $R^\star_i$. It turns out to be a tradeoff
between the two. Consider, for example, a plant species that is limited by the
amount of nitrogen available, as plants are. And to have a large growth
coefficient $m_i$ the plant must produce abundant seed. To have superior
nitrogen use, measured by a low value of $R^\star$, it needs abundant roots. But
it cannot do both. There is a limited amount of solar energy to exploit, so if
the plant allocates more to roots there is less to allocate to seeds, and vice
versa.

It therefore turns out that species which are good *colonizers*, producing
abundant seed, are poorer *competitors* for resources, having a higher
value of $R^\star$. This idea is illustrated by measurements reported in
{numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_7>`.

**Figure 16.7.** `<figdef tag="FigTradeoffYT">`
Tradeoff measured between colonization and ability to exploit nitrogen
(Tilman 1994, {\sl Ecology} 75:2--16).
`</figdef>`

In {numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_8>`, tradeoffs are formulated for modelling.
Species 2 grows more rapidly when resources are abundant. This is the case at
time 0, marked with $t_0$ on the top axis.

**Figure 16.8.** `<figdef tag="FigTradeoffTwoSPP">`
Two species individual growth rate versus resource level, whose time-course is
illustrated in Figure *FigTradeoffTwoSPPtime*.
`</figdef>`

As the populations grow they reduce the amount of resource available in the
environment. At time 1, marked with $t_1$ on the upper axis, Species 2 can
continue to grow faster than Species 1, though the margin is deteriorating. But
there comes a point at which the resources become depleted enough that the
characteristics of Species 2 do not let it gather enough resources to maintain
its advantage. This is the crossing point of the blue and red lines in the
figure. At time 2, both species are still growing, but Species 1 is growing
faster. At time 3, with still lower resource levels---drawn down by
Species 1---the resource falls below the minimal level for Species 2,
$R^\star_2$. The growth rate of Species 2 falls negative and Species 2 starts to
die out.

Finally, at time 4, Species 1 depletes the resource to the level that it can
just barely survive, and it stands alone, having wiped out its competitor. This
process is called "competitive exclusion."

<+>How this plays out over time is illustrated in
{numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_9>`. At the top, Species 2 alone does just
fine, rapidly rising to its carrying capacity of 50 and pulling the resource
down to its $R^\star$ of 2. In the middle, Species 1 alone also does just fine,
rapidly rising to its carrying capacity of 60 and pulling the resource down to
its $R^\star$ of 1.

**Figure 16.9.** `<figdef tag="FigTradeoffTwoSPPtime">`
Competitive exclusion based on the tradeoffs of Figure *FigTradeoffTwoSPP*.
`</figdef>`

But grown together, Species 2 makes an initial splash and then declines. This is
due to the incessant growth of Species 1, which outcompetes it. Species 1 simply
draws the resource down below the level at which Species 2 can survive.

Competitive exclusion, which assumed that no more species could exist than there
were resources, was treated as an inviolable law of ecology for over fifty
years. In the 1970s, however, this was shown not to be the case (Armstrong and
McGehee 1980). More about that later in the chapter.

### 16.4 Succession

A similar process for more than two species results in a succession of species
taking over, one after the other, in an ecological process known as
"succession."

**Figure 16.10.** `<figdef tag="FigTradeoffFiveSPP">`
Multi-species individual growth rate versus resource level, whose time-course is
illustrated in Figure *FigTradeoffFiveSPPtime*.
`</figdef>`

In natural systems many species compete, with tradeoffs between their $R^\star$
values and their growth rates, as in {numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_10>`. The
following is a program to simulate the differential equations for five species
competing for the same resource and producing the curves of
{numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_10>`. With only two species, this same
program can produce the curves of {numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_9>`.

<+>An environment can change because species living in it have effects that can
"feed back" and change the environment itself. In this case the feedback is
change in the resource level, which each successive species changes in a way
that is compatible with its own existence. There is nothing teleological in
this; any species that change the environment in ways not compatible with their
own existence simply do not persist, and hence are not observed.

When the program runs, it produces a file excerpted below, which is graphed in
Figure {numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_11>`.

**Figure 16.11.** `<figdef tag="FigTradeoffFiveSPPtime">`
Succession based on the tradeoffs of Figure *FigTradeoffFiveSPP*.
`</figdef>`

At the beginning in {numref}`Figure %s <fig_16_11>`, from time 0 to
about time 3, the resource is at its maximum level, $R_{\rm max}$, and the
abundances of all species are at very low levels. Between times 3 and
5---Species 5, the one with the highest growth rate when resources are
abundant---increases rapidly while resources drop accordingly. But near the end
of that time the next in the series, Species 4, starts to increase, pulling the
resource down below the level that allows Species 5 to survive. Species 5
therefore declines while Species 4 increases.

This process continues in succession, with Species 3 replacing 4, 2 replacing 3,
and, finally, Species 1 replacing 2. The resource falls in stages as each
successive species gains dominance. Finally, when no more superior species
exist, the system reaches what is called its "climax condition" at about
time 90, with resources at a low level.

There is nothing especially remarkable about Species 1. It is simply
(1) the best competitor living in the region, meaning better competitors cannot
readily arrive on the scene, or
(2) the best competitor that evolutionary processes have yet produced. In either
case, it is subject to replacement by another---for example, by an "invasive
species" arriving by extraordinary means.

Of course, succession in complex natural systems may not be as clear-cut as in
our simple models. Multiple resources are involved, species may be very close to
each other in their ecological parameters, and stochastic events may intervene
to add confusion.

### 16.5 Single-resource phase space

Some aspects of competition for a resource are clarified by looking at the phase
space, as introduced in Chapter *ChPhaseSpace*. Combining
Equations *EqCompetition-nspR*  and  *EqCompetition-nspN*
gives the following as a starting point:
$$\eqalign{
 \Q1/{N_1}\Q{dN_1}/{dt} &= m_1(R_{\rm max}\!-\!R_1^\star) -u_1 m_1 N_1 -u_2 m_2 N_2 \cr
 \Q1/{N_2}\Q{dN_2}/{dt} &= m_2(R_{\rm max}\!-\!R_2^\star) -u_2 m_2 N_2 -u_1 m_1 N_1 \cr} \eqno()$$

{\kern10.5em\stack{$\uparrow$,,$r_i$}
          \kern3.2em\stack{$\uparrow$,$s_{i,i} N_i$}
          \kern2.3em\stack{$\uparrow$,$s_{i,j} N_j$}}

As before, $m_i$ is the rate of growth of Species $i$ for each level
of resource above its minimum resource requirement $R_i^\star$, and
$u_i$ is the amount of resource tied up in each individual of
Species $i$. For reference, here is the assignment of parameters in terms
of $r_i$ and $s_{i,j}$.

<figdef FigCphaseC>
Single-species parallel isoclines.
Each species increases only below its respective isocline, shaded with gray with
the species number, 1 or 2.
`</figdef>`

Notice this: In terms of the resource, the slope of the isocline for Species 2
is identical to the slope for Species 1---both are equal to $(u_1 m_1)/(u_2
m_2)$. What does this mean? It means that the two isoclines are parallel. And
that, in turn, means that the two species cannot permanently coexist.

The populations can fall into only one of the three regions of
Figure *FigCphaseC*.
If they start in the upper region, they decrease until they enter the middle region.
If they start in the lower region, they increase until they also enter the middle region.
Once in the middle region, only Species 2 increases. That means
the population of Species 1 is driven leftward, toward lower  values of $N_1$, while
the population of Species 2 is driven upward,   toward higher values of $N_2$.

<figdef FigCphaseD>
Flow across the phase space, as explained in Chapter *ChPhaseSpace*,
converging on a stable equilibrium where Species 2 excludes Species 1.
($r_1\!=\!0.75$,
 $r_2\!=\!0.52$,
 $s_{12}\!=\!-1.875$,
 $s_{21}\!=\!-0.533$,
 $s_{11}\!=\!s_{22}\!=\!-1$).
`</figdef>`

These dynamics show up in the flow diagram of
Figure *FigCphaseD*.
The origin (0,0) is an unstable equilibrium. In this single-resource system, any
populations near extinction, but not completely extinct, increase until they hit
the middle region. The horizontal axis has another unstable equilibrium, where
Species 1 is at its carrying capacity and Species 2 is extinct
$(-r_1/s_{1,1},0)$. Any populations near that unstable equilibrium soon
arrive in the middle region. All populations not precisely on one of those two
unstable equilibria converge on the red disc on the vertical axis, where Species
2 is at its carrying capacity, $K_2=-r_2/s_{2,2}$, and Species 1 is extinct
$(0,-r_2/s_{2,2})$. This equilibrium is called a "global attractor."

<+>Phase spaces thus provide another view of competitive exclusion, the theory
of which applies at least to two species competing for a single resource at
equilibrium.

### 16.6 Multiple resource phase space

As the next step, consider the case of two
essential resources. This can be done mathematically following the approach we
used earlier for a single resource.

Call the two resources $R_A$ and $R_B$. Suppose that of the total of these two
resources used by Species 1, a proportion $p_1$ is Resource A and therefore a
proportion $q_1=1\!-\!p_1$ is Resource B. Likewise, for Species 2 a proportion
$p_2$ is Resource A and $q_2=1\!-\!p_2$ is Resource B.

This is confusing, so for a clarifying example, suppose $R_A$ is phosphate,
PO$_4$,  and $R_B$ is silicate, SiO$_2$, both essential to two species of algae
in a waterway. Take Species 1 to be an *Asterionella* species and Species 2
to be a *Cyclotella* species, as in a pioneering study by David Tilman
(1977).  In this case, Species 1 needs
phosphate and silicate resources in about a 1:99 ratio, while Species 2 needs
them in about a 6:94 ratio. If silicate is low, Species 1 will thus suffer
first, since it needs a larger proportion of it, while Species 2 will suffer
first if phosphate is low, for the related reason. Here it would be
$p_1=0.01$, $q_1=1\!-\!p_1=0.99$ for the use of Resources A and B by Species 1, and
$p_2=0.06$, $q_1=1\!-\!p_1=0.94$ for use by Species 2.

With $u_1$ being the total amount of resource tied up by each individual of
Species 1, $p_1\,u_1$ will be the amount of Resource A tied up by Species 1 and
$q_1\,u_1$ the amount of Resource B tied up the same way. Similarly, $p_2\,u_2$
will be the amount of Resource A tied up by each individual of Species 2 and
$q_2\,u_2$ the amount of Resource B. Also, assume as before that the resources
under consideration disappear from the environment when they are taken up by
individuals newly born, are released immediately when individuals die.

With this in mind, the resources remaining at any time, as functions of the
maximum resource and the abundance of each species, will be
<eqdef tag="EqMultResA"/>
$$\eqalign{
 R_A &= R_{A\rm max} -p_1 u_1 N_1 -p_2 u_2 N_2 \cr
 R_A &= R_{B\rm max} -q_1 u_1 N_1 -q_2 u_2 N_2 \cr }\eqno(\EqMultResA)$$
Suppose that populations of Species 1 and 2 grow based on which resource is
closest to the $R^\star$ experienced by that species for the resource. This can
be represented by the "min" function, $\min(a,b)$, which selects the
smaller of two values. For
example, $\min(200,10)=10$, $\min(-200,10)=-200$. Now the
two-species, two-resource growth equations, generalizing the single-species,
single-resource growth in Equation *EqResourceSingle*, are
$$\eqalign{
 \Q{1}/{N_1}\Q{dN_1}/{dt} &= m_1\,\min(R_A-R_{1A}^\star,\, R_B-R_{1B}^\star) \cr\noalign{\vskip4pt}
 \Q{1}/{N_2}\Q{dN_2}/{dt} &= m_2\,\min(R_A-R_{2A}^\star,\, R_B-R_{2B}^\star)\,. \cr}$$
This could be refined, so that the growth rates $m_1$ and $m_2$ would depend on
which resource was limiting, but this does not matter in the present analysis.

If the species are similar enough and the resource level is such that they are
limited by the same resource, one will tend to be competitively excluded, as in
the previous section. But if the two species are quite different, they can be
limited by different resources and the equations can be simplified.
<eqdef tag="EqMultResC"/>
$$\eqalign{
   \Q{1}/{N_1}\Q{dN_1}/{dt} &= m_1(R_A-R_{1A}^\star) \cr
   \Q{1}/{N_2}\Q{dN_2}/{dt} &= m_2(R_B-R_{2B}^\star) \cr }\eqno(\EqMultResC)$$

Some algebra will reveal the basic properties. If you substitute the expressions
for $R_1$ and $R_2$ from Equation *EqMultResA*  into
Equation *EqMultResC*  you will get
$$\eqalign{
 \Q{1}/{N_1}\Q{dN_1}/{dt} &= m_1\,(R_{A\rm max} -p_1 u_1 N_1 -p_2 u_2 N_2 -R_{1A}^\star) \cr
 \Q{1}/{N_2}\Q{dN_2}/{dt} &= m_2\,(R_{B\rm max} -q_1 u_1 N_1 -q_2 u_2 N_2 -R_{2B}^\star) \cr }$$
Now if you expand, collect, and rearrange terms, you get this equivalent form:
<eqdef EqRSNformC2sp/>
$$\eqalign{
 \Q{1}/{N_1}\Q{dN_1}/{dt}\!&= m_1\,(R_{A\rm max}\!-\!R_{A1}^\star) \!-\!m_1\,p_1 u_1\,N_1 \!-\!m_1\,p_2 u_2\,N_2 \cr
 \Q{1}/{N_2}\Q{dN_2}/{dt}\!&= m_2\,(R_{B\rm max}\!-\!R_{B2}^\star) \!-\!m_2\,q_2 u_2\,N_2 \!-\!m_2\,q_1 u_1\,N_1 \cr }
 \eqno(\EqRSNformC2sp) $$

{\kern8.0em\stack{$\uparrow$,$r_i$}
          \kern6.2em\stack{$\uparrow$,$s_{i,i} N_i$}
          \kern3.4em\stack{$\uparrow$,$s_{i,j} N_j$}}

Notice that, again, a mechanistic model with measurable parameters is just the
general ecological {\sc rsn} model in disguise.

The {\sc rsn} formulation can expose the possibilities of two-resource
situations in phase space. The isoclines are Equations *EqIsoclineSp1*
and *EqIsoclineSp2*  of this chapter, with slopes
$-s_{1,1}/s_{1,2}$ and
$-s_{2,1}/s_{2,2}$ for Species 1 and 2, respectively.

These two slopes can be written in terms of the resource. With the values for
$s_{i,j}$ from Equation *EqRSNformC2sp*
($s_{1,1}= -m_1\,p_1 u_1$,
  $s_{1,2}= -m_1\,p_2 u_2$,
  $s_{2,1}= -m_2\,q_1 u_1$, and
  $s_{2,2}= -m_2\,q_2 u_2$),
the slopes of the isoclines become
$$\eqalign{
  \Q{s_{1,1}}/{s_{1,2}} &= \Q{-m_1\,p_1 u_1}/{-m_1\,p_2 u_2}
                         = \Q{u_1}/{u_2} \, \Q{p_1}/{p_2} \cr\noalign{\vskip 4pt}
  \Q{s_{2,1}}/{s_{2,2}} &= \Q{-m_2\,q_1 u_1}/{-m_2\,q_2 u_2}
                         = \Q{u_1}/{u_2} \, \Q{1-p_1}/{1-p_2} \cr }$$

First notice that if the two species use the two resources in equal proportions
(if $p_1=p_2$), both slopes become $u_1/u_2$. The slopes are parallel,
as in the single-resource case in Figures *FigCphaseA*
through *FigCphaseD*. Therefore, if two species use two different
resources identically---that is, in equal proportions---they do not coexist.
Coexistence requires some difference in how they use resources.

<+>However, using the resources differently does not guarantee coexistence.
Depending on their $p$'s and $q$'s, one isocline could still enclose the other
completely. Figure *FigCphase-2res2*  has the same properties as
Figure *FigCphaseD*. Everywhere below the red isocline, Species 2 will
increase, including the broad band between the red and blue isoclines where
Species 1 will decrease.

In all three cases, from Figures *FigCphaseD*

$(0,0)$, where both species are absent, at the carrying capacity $K_1$ for
Species 1 alone $(-r_1/s_{1,1},0)$, and at the carrying capacity $K_2$ for
Species 2 alone $(0, -r_2/s_{2,2})$. The origin is unstable and only one of the
other two equilibria is stable, depending on which isocline encloses the other.

<+>Figures *FigCphase-2res2*  and *FigCphase-2res3*  can be
combined to give each species a chance to exclude the other, depending on
circumstances. This means not allowing one isocline to completely enclose the
other, as in Figure *FigCphaseCx*. Intersecting isoclines introduce a
fourth equilibrium at the interior of the phase space. This equilibrium is
unstable, marked with an open circle, and the two equilibria for the individual
species, on the axes, are stable. They are no longer "globally stable,"
however, since only local regions of the phase space lead to either of them.

Depending on where the populations start, one of the two species will exclude
the other. A curve called a
"separatrix,"[$^\star$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatrix_(mathematics))
dividing these starting points according to which species will exclude the
other, is shown with the dashed black line in Figure *FigCphase-2res4*.
That separatrix corresponds to a long curved ridge in any surface above the
phase space, as described in Chapter *ChPhaseSpace*. It necessarily
passes through the unstable interior equilibrium. Here it is a simple curve,
though in some cases (such as the Mandelbrot
system,[$^\star$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) not representing
competition), related curves can be infinitely complex.

<+>Finally, the isoclines can intersect in the opposite way, as in
Figure *FigCphase-2res5*. In this case, neither species has any region
where its isocline encloses the other, as seen in each of the phase spaces of
Figures *FigCphaseD*  through *FigCphase-2res4*. What will
happen when neither species can exclude the other in any part of the phase
space? They are forced to coexist. The individual equilibria on the axes become
unstable and the interior equilibrium becomes stable---indeed, globally stable.

<figdef FigCompetitionOpen>
Case 1: Species 2 excludes Species 1.
Case 2: Species 1 excludes Species 2.
Case 3: one excludes the other, depending on starting conditions.
Case 4: both species coexist.
`</figdef>`

<+>In summary, the isoclines in competitive systems have four different
configurations, as in Figure *FigCompetitionOpen*. Cases 1 and 2 can
represent competition for a single resource or, equivalently, competition for
two different resources that the two species handle identically. One of the two
is a superior competitor that excludes the other. Case 3 is "bistable,"
where either of the species can exclude the other, depending on how the system
starts out. Finally, Case 4 is globally stable, where neither species can
exclude the other, and stable coexistence prevails. Cases 3 and 4 can represent
competition for two different resources.

### 16.7 Lotka--Volterra formulation

Competition equations are usually presented in textbooks as the Lotka--Volterra
competition
model.[$^\star$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_Lotka‚ÄìVolterra_equations)
This first appeared in the ecological literature in the 1920s and is defined not
just in terms of the interactions among species, but also in terms of the
species' carrying capacities,   as follows.
<eqdef tag="EqLotkaVolterraCompetition"/>
$$\eqalign{
  {1\over N_1}{dN_1\over dt} &= r_1 \left(1-{N_1+a_{1,2} N_2 \over K_1}\right) \cr
  {1\over N_2}{dN_2\over dt} &= r_2 \left(1-{N_2+a_{2,1} N_1 \over K_2}\right) \cr }
\eqno(\EqLotkaVolterraCompetition) $$

$K_1$ and $K_2$ are the carrying capacities for Species 1 and 2, respectively.
Parameters $a_{1,2}$ and $a_{2,1}$ represent the interference by each species on
the other. If $a_{1,2}=2$, for example, each individual of Species 2 interferes
with the growth of Species 1 as if it were two individuals of Species 1. If, on
the other hand, $a_{1,2}=1/2$, it takes two individuals of Species 2 to have the
same negative effect on the growth of Species 1 as one individual of Species 1
itself.

To compare this with the {\sc rsn} formulation, represent
Equation *EqLotkaVolterraCompetition*  with $i$ and $j$ subscripts
$$ {1\over N_i}{dN_i\over dt} = r_i \left(1-{N_i+a_{i,j} N_j \over K_i}\right) $$
and multiply the right hand side through by $r_i$,
$$ {1\over N_i}{dN_i\over dt} = r_i -\Q{r_i}/{K_i}N_i -\Q{a_{i,j} r_i}/{K_i} N_j $$

This shows that the Lotka--Volterra formulation is isomorphic to the {\sc rsn}
formulation. All conclusions about competitive systems examined thus far apply
to the Lotka--Volterra formulation as well, with the appropriate translation of
parameters. Parameter $r_i$ is the same in both in the Lotka--Volterra
formulation and the {\sc rsn} formulation, but $s_{i,i}=-r_i/K_i$ and
$s_{i,j}=-a_{i,j}\,r_i/K_i$.

<+>Beware, however, of a widely quoted statement derived from this formulation
that appears throughout the ecological literature and textbooks. Statements like
"Coexistence requires that each species inhibit itself more than it inhibits
the other species" are abundant in textbooks and in the ecological
literature. Alas, those statements are not correct.

To see this, examine Figure *FigCphase-2res5*. Here Species 1 inhibits
itself with $s_{11}\!=\!-1$, while it inhibits the other species more
strongly with $s_{12}\!=\!-1.153$. Yet there is global coexistence.
Evidently, coexistence {\it does not} require that each species inhibit itself
more than it inhibits the other, as in the conventional wisdom.

The confusion in the literature has apparently emerged from the presence of the
carrying capacity terms, $K_1$ and $K_2$, in the Lotka--Volterra
formulation. These terms obscure the effects of the interaction terms,
$a_{1,2}$ and $a_{2,1}$, when carrying capacities differ between the
species.

<boxdef BoxCoexistenceRule></boxdef>

<shaded height=.65 color=lightyellow>
*Coexistence in the Lotka--Volterra model requires that each species be able
to increase from low densities when the other species is at its single-species
equilibrium.*
</shaded>

What, then, is a correct statement about coexistence? It can be put in terms of
increasing from low densities, as shown in Box *BoxCoexistenceRule*.
The qualifying phrase "*from low densities*" is required, because the
species not present can increase from high densities in a bistable system, as in
Figure *FigCphase-2res4*, and flip it to the other state, even though
coexistence cannot occur.

Another way in which coexistence has been explained is by Vandermeer (1981
*Bioscience*), connecting coexistence with a certain kind of
"overyielding," wherein two crops require less land for the same annual
productivity when growing together than when growing apart. The test is whether
the joint equilibrium is above a line connecting the single-species equilibria
(dashed gray in Figure *FigVandermeerCurvedIsoclines A*) or below the
line (Figure *FigVandermeerCurvedIsoclines B*).

This view is correct for models we have been considering with straight-line
isoclines, but incorrect for more general models with curved isoclines
(Figure *FigVandermeerCurvedIsoclines C, D*). The statement in
Box *BoxCoexistenceRule*, however, holds true in each of these cases.
