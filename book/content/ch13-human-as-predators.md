## Humans as predators

Early humans suffered from predators just as other primates suffer still.
Eventually, though, they developed spears longer than the longest teeth and
became one of the top predators on land. Even if they did not eat sabre-tooth
tigers, they were able to kill them. We know from vivid paintings on rock walls
in the protected shelter of caves that our ancestors at least fancied themselves
as hunters (Figure [13.1](fig_13_1)).

Humans are now the dominant large vertebrate on the planet. But on all the
continents beyond Africa, large vertebrates were prominent in the ecosystems
before our ancestors arrived. In Africa many remain, coevolved with humans and
perhaps wiser to our ways. Elsewhere, however, they had little fear when our
ancestors arrived (Figure [13.2](fig_13_2)).

Hunter and hunted.

Artist's conception. The Moa had no clue that the diminutive primate was aiming
a barb that would shortly pierce its heart. Unafraid and then gone.

The reasons behind the extinction of so many megafauna are controversial.
Archeologist   Haynes and others believe humans are responsible.
Archeologist   Grayson and others blame climate change, though
animals had been through many glaciations and deglaciations
before. Mammalogist   MacPhee and virologist
  Marx postulate a virulent "hyperdisease" brought by
humans. And geologist   Kennett and colleagues assign a comet
impact as the cause---an interesting theory, as some major
human hunters disappeared at about the same time as the larger mammals.

In any case, when something extreme happens, several causes may be working in
concert. We do know from historical records that only about one human lifetime
ago our predecessors in North America hunted bison almost to extinction
(Figure *FigBisonBonesHerd*). Now the large remaining populations of
megafauna are in the seas. What is their fate?
