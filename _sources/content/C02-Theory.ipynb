    "Ecology covers a vast range of topics and can be viewed on multiple levels. One\n",

    "behavior as part of ecology.\n",
    "*Population ecology* covers groups of organisms of the same species---a\n",
    "bison herd or a grove of maples.\n",
    "*Community ecology* looks at how different populations interact, and the\n",
    "communities examined can be quite large.\n",
    "Above this level is *ecosystem ecology*, which examines how different\n",
    "communities interact with their environments. Finally, there is *global\n",

    "## Role of theory\n",
    "\n",
    "From its early days, ecology has been in part a theoretical--mathematical\n",
    "science, and it is now also a\n",
    "computational science. Mathematical theory arises where systems are relatively\n",
    "simple. In our modern era, computation can address somewhat more complex\n",
    "systems, though creating computations on complex systems that satisfy the basic\n",
    "tenets of science is still problematic. For very complex systems, narrative is\n",
    "all we have available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the levels in {numref}`LevelsOfEcology` to think about\n",
    "where theory applies. Subatomic particles and atoms are the realm of quantum\n",
    "mechanics, one of the most sublime and successful theories. Theory applies\n",
    "nicely to the hydrogen atom, a two-particle object. And while it applies to\n",
    "larger atoms, the raw mathematics becomes too complex as the number of particles\n",
    "grows, so computation comes into play. At higher levels like the molecular one,\n",
    "theory is harder to apply. Organic chemistry, for example, is not a strongly\n",
    "mathematical science, and at the level of protoplasm and cells there is no\n",
    "comprehensive mathematical theory or computational equivalent. This level is far\n",
    "too complex -- with minuscule molecular machines running along tubules and\n",
    "carrying mitochondria on their backs at high speed relative to their size, it is\n",
    "more complex than any industrial factory. At the level of tissues and organs\n",
    "systems, we have only narratives to guide our understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens, then, at the level of organisms, at the entry to ecology?\n",
    "Individual organisms are exceedingly complex. There is no complete mathematical\n",
    "theory for the internal operation of individual organisms. But externally,\n",
    "organisms behave as a unit and populations become simpler than\n",
    "individuals -- glossing over heartbeat, neuron firing rates, white blood cell\n",
    "replication, and so on, with all their enormous complexity. Details disappear.\n",
    "Populations can be described with basic mathematics. Communities are more\n",
    "complex, but are still within the reach of mathematics and, particularly, within\n",
    "the reach of computation. And ecosystems are complex, but with some unifying\n",
    "properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole earth thus begins to be simpler, and at the level of planets and solar\n",
    "systems, things once again become nicely mathematical. This is the level where,\n",
    "with Newton, modern science was born. In part, this emerging simplicity is\n",
    "because levels of detail again merge together. At the level of planetary orbits,\n",
    "it does not matter that dinosaurs once dominated the planet or that Mozart ever\n",
    "wrote any concertos.\n",
    "\n",
    "At larger scales still, solar systems are completely describable with computers,\n",
    "although the mathematics becomes difficult, and as we move out into galaxies and\n",
    "the entire universe the descriptions become difficult again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing scales thus involves the successive movement in and out of simplicity.\n",
    "Where is the complexity in the universe greatest? It turns out to be at about\n",
    "one meter. In other words, at our scale. A great spike in complexity appears\n",
    "just where we and other forms of life arose.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is no accident. A philosophical idea called the weak anthropic principle\n",
    "suggests that any part of the universe that can sit around and contemplate\n",
    "itself and the larger universe must itself be complex. We are constrained to\n",
    "live at a scale of great complexity, or not to exist at all. That is worth some\n",
    "reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we try to find simplicity among this complexity, to let us feel we\n",
    "understand, and to let us predict what can happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Science strives for simplicity, and models are part of the process. What is a\n",
    "model? It is just a simplified view of something more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"model\" is used here essentially as it's used in everyday English.\n",
    "For example, in ordinary English, \"modeling clay\" can be used to make\n",
    "simplified miniatures of three-dimensional images of animals, automobiles,\n",
    "buildings, or even full-scale three-dimensional images of objects like the human\n",
    "heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"model airplane\" can be rendered to show at a glance the physical\n",
    "appearance of a large aircraft, and can even be constructed to fly so as to test\n",
    "aerodynamics under proper rescaling. A \"model organism\" is a simpler\n",
    "organism that may respond to medical tests or treatments in ways similar to\n",
    "those of a more complex organism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the fashion model on the runway meets this definition of a simplified view\n",
    "of something more complex. The infinite complexity of the human spirit is not\n",
    "relevant on the runway; all that is relevant in this context is the person as a\n",
    "realistic way to display fashions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book focuses on computational and mathematical models of ecological\n",
    "systems. What is left out of these models is as important as what is put in.\n",
    "Simplification is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "If you have a complex natural system you don't understand, and you construct a\n",
    "computer model incorporating everything you can about that natural system, you\n",
    "now have two systems you don't understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- after Chris Payola, UMN\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different simplifications of time are commonly used in ecological models:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *[Discrete time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_time_and_continuous_time)*: Events\n",
    "happen at periodic time steps, as if time is non-existent in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *[Continuous time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_time_and_continuous_time)*: Events\n",
    "happen smoothly and at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there are two different classes of models:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *[Macroscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscale_and_macroscale_models)*: Individual\n",
    "organisms are not tracked, but are measured in aggregate and represented by\n",
    "composite variables such as $N$.\n",
    "  - *[Microscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscale_and_macroscale_models)*: Individual\n",
    "organisms are tracked separately. These are also known as agent-based or\n",
    "individual-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macroscale models can be handled either by computers or mathematics, but\n",
    "microscale models are usually restricted to computers. Keep in mind that all\n",
    "four categories are only approximations of reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in this book we will also explore mechanistic versus phenomenological\n",
    "models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Present state\n",
    "\n",
    "As a surprising side note, the standard models commonly taught in ecology\n",
    "courses are not complete, and a main purpose of this book is to help make them\n",
    "more so. One aspect of theory related to simple species, for instance -- called\n",
    "orthologistic population growth -- is rarely even studied, much less taught, yet\n",
    "is essential for understanding rapidly growing populations, including human\n",
    "populations in millennia past. For two-species interactions, another theory\n",
    "concerning mutualisms and a related kind of population growth is highly\n",
    "under-developed, and the theory of three-species interactions is even less\n",
