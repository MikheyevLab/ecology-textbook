    "# 11 State space\n",
    "\n",
    "Closely related to [“phase spaces”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space) are [“state spaces”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space). While phase spaces are typically used with continuous systems, described by differential equations, state spaces are used with discrete-time systems, described by difference equations. Here the natural system is approximated by jumps from one state to the next, as described in Chapter 7, rather than by smooth transitions. While the two kinds of spaces are similar, they differ in important ways.\n",

    "Inspired by the complexities of ecology, and triggered in part by [Robert May’s bombshell paper](http://abel.harvard.edu/archive/118r_spring_05/docs/may.pdf) of 1976, an army of mathematicians worked during the last quarter of the twentieth century to understand these complexities, focusing on discrete-time systems and state spaces. One endlessly inter- esting state space is the delayed logistic equation ([Aronson et al. 1982](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald-Aronson/publication/38329204_Bifurcations_from_an_Invariant_Circle_for_Two-Parameter_Families_of_Maps_of_the_Plane_A_Computer-Assisted_Study/links/551c18b80cf2fe6cbf7661ec/Bifurcations-from-an-Invariant-Circle-for-Two-Parameter-Families-of-Maps-of-the-Plane-A-Computer-Assisted-Study.pdf)), an outgrowth of the discrete-time logistic equation described in Chapter 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a biological interpretation of the delayed logistic equation, let’s examine the example of live grassland biomass coupled with last year’s leaf litter. Biomass next year ($N_{t+1}$) is positively related to biomass this year ($N_{t}$), but negatively related to biomass from the previous year ($N_{t−1}$). The more biomass in the previous year, the more litter this year and the greater the inhibitory shading of next year’s growth. The simplest approximation here is that all biomass is converted to litter, a fixed portion of the litter decays each year, and inhibition from litter is linear. This is not perfectly realistic, but it has the essential properties for an example. Field data and models have recorded this kind of inhibition ([Tilman and Wedin, Nature 1991](https://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1186.pdf)) (read coverage of this paper in the New York Times [here](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/22/news/balance-of-nature-what-balance-is-that.html?pagewanted=all).\n",

Here the system starts at the plus sign, at time $t = 0$, with living biomass $N_{1} = 0.5$ and litter biomass $N_{2} = 0.1$. The next year, at time $t = 1$, living biomass increases to $N_{1} = 0.85$ and litter to $N_{2} = 0.5$. The third year, $t = 2$, living biomass is inhibited slightly to $N_{1} = 0.81$ and litter builds up to $N_{2} = 0.85$. Next, under a heavy litter layer, biomass drops sharply to $N_{1} = 0.22$, and so forth about the cycle. The equilibrium is called an [“attractor”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor) because populations are pulled into it."
