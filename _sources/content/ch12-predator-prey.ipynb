    "# Predator and prey\n",
    "\n",
    "Competition and mutualism can be understood without much attention to the sizes\n",
    "of the species involved. But predation is quite different. Think of a producer,\n",
    "the prey, and a consumer, the predator. When the consumer is extremely large and\n",
    "the producer very small, as with a whale and krill, the relationship is called\n",
    "filter feeding. There the predator kills the prey. When the producer and\n",
    "consumer are roughly matched in size, they are called predators and prey. When\n",
    "the producer is much smaller than the consumer, but still independently mobile,\n",
    "the relationship is called parasitism. And when the consumer is much smaller\n",
    "still, and has difficulty moving around on its own, the relationship is called\n",
    "infection and disease. Symptoms of disease are part of the ecology of disease.\n",
    "In parasitism and disease, the consumer often does not kill the producer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further examples of predation\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazing mechanisms for both capturing prey and avoiding predators have\n",
    "been discovered through evolution.\n",
    "Fulmar chicks,[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulmar), for example, can direct\n",
    "\"projectile vomit\" at predators approaching the nest too closely\n",
    "(Figure 12.1[fig_12_1]). This is not just icky for the predator. By\n",
    "damaging the waterproofing of an avian predator's feathers, this ultimately can\n",
    "kill the predator. The chick's projectile vomit is thus a lethal weapon.\n",

    "One of the most remarkable predatory weapons is that of\n",
    "[pistol shrimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpheidae) (Figure 12.2[fig12_2]).\n",
    "These shrimp have one special claw adapted to cavitation, and are capable of shooting bullets at their\n",
    "prey; colonies of these shrimp are loud from the sound of these bullets. But\n",
    "where does an underwater crustacean get bullets? Actually, it creates them from\n",
    "nothing at all---from cavitation. If you've ever piloted a powerful motorboat\n",
    "and pushed the throttle too hard, or watched a pilot do so, you've seen the\n",
    "propellers start kicking out bubbles, which look like air bubbles. But the\n",
    "propellers are well below the water line, where there is no air. The propellers\n",
    "are in fact creating bubbles of vacuum---separating the water so instantly that\n",
    "there is nothing left in between, except perhaps very low density water vapor.\n",
    "Such bubbles collapse back with numerous blasts, each so powerful that it rips\n",
    "off pieces of bronze off the propeller itself, leaving a rough surface that is\n",
    "the telltale sign of cavitation.\n",

    "A pistol shrimp snap its pistol claw together so quickly that it creates a vacuum\n",
    "where water used to be. With the right circulation of water around the vacuum\n",
    "bubble, the bubble can move, and a shrimp can actually project its bullet of\n",
    "vacuum toward its prey. When the bubble collapses, the effect is like thunder\n",
    "attending a lightning bolt, when air snaps together after the lightning has\n",
    "created a column of near-vacuum (NatGeo video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkY_mSwboMQ]). But the consequences are quite different in\n",
    "water. While a loud sound might hurt the ears of a terrestrial animal, the sound\n",
    "does not rip apart the fabric of the animal's body. This is, however, what\n",
    "intense sounds in water can do, traveling through water and through the\n",
    "water-filled bodies of animals. In effect, pistol shrimp shoot bullets that\n",
