    "\n",
    "With caveats in mind, consider definitions of ecology. In the 1860s, [Ernst\n",
    "Haeckel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel) combined the term\n",
    "*oikos*---a place to live, home, habitat---with *logia*---discourse,\n",
    "study---to coin the word \"ecology.\" In the 1890s [Ellen\n",
    "Richards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Swallow_Richards) included humans\n",
    "and harmony, quite a modern view. Variations over the years are shown in {numref}`ViewsEcology`.\n",

    "Each of these definitions has merit, but the first two and the last two are\n",
    "closest to the way the term is applied in this book. We humans have become\n",
    "prominent in ecology, locally to globally. No modern treatment of ecology is\n",
    "complete without a strong dose of anthropology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition by Andrewartha has been widely quoted, but focusing merely on\n",
    "distribution and abundance reduces ecology to mapping, which is why Krebs\n",
    "modified this definition. The Pope's definition from his 2015 Encyclical\n",
    "includes the interesting idea of development, which can be taken to mean\n",
    "short-term development like embryogenesis and growth, plus long-term development\n",
    "like evolution. Overall, the definition by Eilts is perhaps the most general and\n",
    "engaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, the most important concepts in ecology are about\n",
    "relationships, plus all of life, the whole environment, the processes of living\n",
    "and development, and, above all context. And in today's world, harmony. But also\n",
    "consider, \"Poetry is the subject of the poem\" (Wallace Stevens, 1937) and\n",
    "perhaps \"Ecology is what ecologists do.\" With these in mind, we strive in\n",
    "the remainder of this book to define a theoretical form of ecology through\n",
    "examples and demonstrations, representative models and symbols, patterns and\n",

    "Our early hominin ancestors needed aspects of ecology. To find blueberries or\n",

    "grew---their distribution and abundance. These parts of ecology have thus been\n",

    "Today, ecology has become a glamour word. A product called \"Ecogate,\" for\n",
    "example, is part of a central vacuum system that keeps sawdust and sanding dust\n",
    "from being tracked around. But why the word Ecogate? Dust collection *per\n",
    "se* has nothing to do with ecology. Advertisers, however, have found that\n",
    "consumers respond positively to the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"ecosystem\" is frequently used in business and finance, but there\n",
    "it means a collection of companies, customers, and products and their\n",
    "interconnections. For better or worse, ecological terminology is expanding to\n",
    "other domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods of ecology\n",
    "\n",
    "How do ecologists do ecology? Often, they start with observation, then move to\n",
    "theory---trying to fit observations together to make sense as a whole. Theory\n",
    "then leads to expectations, which in turn lead to experiments. Commonly,\n",
    "experiments aren't undertaken until there is some theory to be tested and\n",
    "understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Observation    <br>\n",
    "(2) Theory         <br>\n",
    "(3) Experiment     <br>\n",
    "(4) Serendipity\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation, theory, and experiment, however, are not the whole story. A large\n",
    "part of science turns out to be serendipity---luck and chance---capitalizing on\n",
    "chance and doing something with it. One example is Alexander\n",
    "Fleming[$^\\star$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fleming), who discovered\n",
    "penicillin. Some of the bacterial cultures in his lab became contaminated with\n",
    "penicillium mold and the cultures died. That ruined his experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "He could have written a memo to the laboratory staff ordering \"Always keep\n",
    "mold away from our bacterial cultures. It destroys the cultures and will ruin\n",
    "the hypotheses we are trying to test.\" But instead he capitalized on the\n",
    "serendipity, wondered what was happening, and found a substance in penicillium\n",
    "mold that kills bacteria. Fungi and bacteria have been archenemies for perhaps a\n",
    "billion years. Fleming's discovery has helped physicians actually {\\it cure}\n",
    "disease, rather than being limited to diagnosing and prognosticating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following up on chance is, then, a large part of science. By the way, for an\n",
    "interesting paper, read the original 1929 report by Fleming about penicillium.\n",
    "It is so understated. He writes \"the name 'penicillin' has been given to\n",
    "filtrates of broth cultures of the mould.\" No one had heard of the word\n",
    "before. Then he suggests that \"it may be an efficient antiseptic.\" One of\n",
    "the greatest discoveries of all time and only, \"it may be an efficient\n",
    "antiseptic.\"\n",

    "event of a deep two-year drought that altered the abundances of species in a\n",
